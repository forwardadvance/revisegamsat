hi everyone out there,</p>
<p>firstly id like to thank you nic, this site has been absolutely fantastic with my prparation for the 2010 GAMSAT!! especially the chemistry section which is without a doubt my most challenging subject. the videos are an ingenious idea for study and the fact that you have organised them into one area and ordered them has helped me heaps so thanks alot for that.</p>
<p>now my question is this, as far as practice questions, other than the ACER ones obviously, do you or anyone have an opinion on which ones are the best in terms of relevance and similarity to the actual GAMSAT? ive heard the des oneill ones are pretty good, are there any others out there that you would recommend?</p>
<p>any help would be great</p>
<p>thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Petec,</p>
<p>So glad the site has been helpful for you! I can't recommend any particular set of questions I'm afraid as I took my GAMSAT on a shoe string, part of the reason for creating this site. I have heard good things about the O'Neill questions and he seems like a nice guy so I think they would be a worthwhile investment.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
