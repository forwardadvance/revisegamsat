	<description><![CDATA[<p>Hi Katie, Thanks :)</p>
<p>Past papers are not available for GAMSAT, all the papers are labelled and collected up at the end. If one is not returned the person who it belonged to doesn't get their mark so there aren't really any floating around.</p>
<p>I found the ACER practice papers pretty good to get an idea of the standard. That said, you can't tell exctly what will come up and the GAMSAT will definitely throw you some curve balls, so it's wise to be overprepared. As I've said before I'd treat this site as a jumping off point. It's everything I revised, but then, I was working some stuff out in the exam which isn't ideal.</p>
<p>Good luck in March!</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Hey Nicholas,</p>
<p>Great site you have here! Just wondered if anyone knew whether the structure/style of GAMSAT has changed much over the years? I have got a set of notes from a Des O'Neill course and sample questions etc from 2005 and wondered if this was still relevant today, or if the information had been updated?</p>
<p>Also, does anyone know if there are any past papers lurking out there anywhere? All I have to actually show me the standard of the test now are the sample questions and a practise paper - obviously a few years past papers would really help! The course notes I have now seem to really punch above the standard in the sample questions - would it be fair to say that the standard of science on this site is more reflective of what is required in the GAMSAT?</p>
<p>I hope so! Decided to sit the March GAMSAT yesterday and am gearing up to blitz this while working full time...!</p>
<p>Thanks for any feedback that may come my way...</p>
<p>Katie</p>
