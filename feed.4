		<description><![CDATA[Hi. Does anyone know of a Nigerian GAMSAT centre? I don&#039;t want to have to travel to the U.K or Ireland just for the test when there&#039;s no real assurance that I might get into UCC #justsaying#. If u know of any GAMSAT centre in Nigeria (or anywhere in west Africa) pls do tell. Thanks all :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi all,

Thanks for all your messages. I just thought I&#039;d take time to write on the site to let you know why I haven&#039;t been active for a little while.

You see, I didn&#039;t get in.

I did well on the Gamsat. I came in the top 5%, which scored me an interview at my preferred university, St. Georges. Unfortunately this didn&#039;t translate into an offer. There were various reasons for this. It was a record year, applications were up 30%, and there were some qualified people, but this is beside the point.

Times have now changed, various things have moved on, and I&#039;ve been forced to accept that medicine is not going to be a part of my life. That&#039;s not to say it hasn&#039;t been worthwhile. Plenty of good has come out of my Gamsat adventure, just not the outcome I had hoped for. I still feel sad about it, but hey.

Thanks to all who helped put this site together, particularly those who contributed essays, and the creators of the videos. I will leave revisegamsat.com up indefinitely, in the hope that it will benefit others. Do let me know if it&#039;s helped you.

If I could offer one piece of advice to future Gamsatters, make sure your experience is substantial, relevant and recent. I worked as a nurse for 2 years, but this was some time ago and wasn&#039;t taken into account. 

If you have any further questions about medicine, I&#039;m afraid I&#039;m not the one to ask. Do take care, and as always, best of luck with it all.

		<description><![CDATA[Hey,

This site is awesome! Im a bit in trouble though because I&#039;m sitting the Gamsat this year 2010 and I&#039;ve only got about 2 Months of prep time. 

Do you think if I go through this website religiously, that&#039;ll be enough to get good results? I am really scared about the science section as I&#039;m an Arts Undergrad, so that I am freaking out right now.
It would be great to know I can learn all this in 2 months...is it possible? 
Thanks!

Ive read on here that the foundation of your revision should be by the books by ACER! Where can I get these books or book from? Any help would be appreciated.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Nic.

First and foremost, a big thanks for this resource.  It is truly fantastic.  Quite how you&#039;ve managed to juggle this and putting an application together for med school is remarkable.  I hope you mentioned the site at interview..! 

Secondly, I&#039;m thinking of sitting GAMSAT in Sept this year.  I got a high 1st in Engineering, graduating 5 years ago, but haven&#039;t studied Chem and Bio in over 10 years.  In your honest opinion, is 4.5 months enough time to get up to speed?

Without GAMSAT, I could still do UKCAT and apply to three med schools.  Do you think I might be better employing that strategy this year and leaving GAMSAT as an option for next year in case I&#039;m not successful?  I love the idea of getting stuck into the GAMSAT material, but I don&#039;t want to jeapardise my UKCAT chances.

Apologies for all the questions.  I sincerely hope this year&#039;s offers brought you good news.

Cheers

Well done for setting up the site. Its really nicely laid out. Thanks a lot.
I have taken this exam before and it&#039;s quite daunting preparing for it the first time around - nice for 1st time candidates to get advice from people who&#039;ve actually sat it and passed.

Nice one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sarosh, You don&#039;t need to remember quotes exactly and you can&#039;t really memorise this stuff because you don&#039;t know what will come up. Just do the best you can based on reading you&#039;ve done throughout your life, things you&#039;ve heard said and things you&#039;ve watched and heard on the TV, radio and internet.

Cheers,

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sarah, This section tests your literacy and your scientific mindset. The only way I can imagine to revise for it is to read widely. The ACER practice papers are a good place to start but also consider subscribing to journals like new scientist.

Speed reading is an essential for the passage qestions. You need to be able to let your eye sort of skip up and down to paragraphs to pull out the salient points. The easiest way to start speed reading is to use your fingers. Use one finger to track down the passage and use others to hold the position of key points, you may be surprised just how much this helps.

I&#039;d also recommend Ben Goldacre as some questions, particularly the cartoon questions in 2009, concerned evidence based medicine.

I&#039;m putting together a guide to part 1 which should be out in early 2010

Cheers
Nic]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi Sarah, This section tests your literacy and your scientific mindset. The only way I can imagine to revise for it is to read widely. The ACER practice papers are a good place to start but also consider subscribing to journals like new scientist.</p>
<p>Speed reading is an essential for the passage qestions. You need to be able to let your eye sort of skip up and down to paragraphs to pull out the salient points. The easiest way to start speed reading is to use your fingers. Use one finger to track down the passage and use others to hold the position of key points, you may be surprised just how much this helps.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also recommend Ben Goldacre as some questions, particularly the cartoon questions in 2009, concerned evidence based medicine.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m putting together a guide to part 1 which should be out in early 2010</p>
<p>Cheers<br />
Nic</p>
