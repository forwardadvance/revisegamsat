	<description><![CDATA[<p>Hey I was just wondering what everyone's using/used to study for each section. For me the lack of official study materials, like an official Gamsat chemistry book, is daunting, because each book will have advantages and drawbacks when used to study for such a unique exam.  </p>
<p>Oh and hope the Irish gamsat went well for everyone last week! <img src="/wp-content/forum/forum-smileys/sf-smile.gif" alt="Smile" /></p>

<blockquote><p>
hi everyone out there,</p>
<p>firstly id like to thank you nic, this site has been absolutely fantastic with my prparation for the 2010 GAMSAT!! especially the chemistry section which is without a doubt my most challenging subject. the videos are an ingenious idea for study and the fact that you have organised them into one area and ordered them has helped me heaps so thanks alot for that.</p>
<p>now my question is this, as far as practice questions, other than the ACER ones obviously, do you or anyone have an opinion on which ones are the best in terms of relevance and similarity to the actual GAMSAT? ive heard the des oneill ones are pretty good, are there any others out there that you would recommend?</p>
<p>any help would be great</p>
<p>thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Petec,</p>
<p>So glad the site has been helpful for you! I can't recommend any particular set of questions I'm afraid as I took my GAMSAT on a shoe string, part of the reason for creating this site. I have heard good things about the O'Neill questions and he seems like a nice guy so I think they would be a worthwhile investment.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Hi Katie, Thanks :)</p>
<p>Past papers are not available for GAMSAT, all the papers are labelled and collected up at the end. If one is not returned the person who it belonged to doesn't get their mark so there aren't really any floating around.</p>
<p>I found the ACER practice papers pretty good to get an idea of the standard. That said, you can't tell exctly what will come up and the GAMSAT will definitely throw you some curve balls, so it's wise to be overprepared. As I've said before I'd treat this site as a jumping off point. It's everything I revised, but then, I was working some stuff out in the exam which isn't ideal.</p>
<p>Good luck in March!</p>
<p>Nic</p>

	<description><![CDATA[<p>Hey Nicholas,</p>
<p>Great site you have here! Just wondered if anyone knew whether the structure/style of GAMSAT has changed much over the years? I have got a set of notes from a Des O'Neill course and sample questions etc from 2005 and wondered if this was still relevant today, or if the information had been updated?</p>
<p>Also, does anyone know if there are any past papers lurking out there anywhere? All I have to actually show me the standard of the test now are the sample questions and a practise paper - obviously a few years past papers would really help! The course notes I have now seem to really punch above the standard in the sample questions - would it be fair to say that the standard of science on this site is more reflective of what is required in the GAMSAT?</p>
<p>I hope so! Decided to sit the March GAMSAT yesterday and am gearing up to blitz this while working full time...!</p>
<p>Thanks for any feedback that may come my way...</p>
<p>Katie</p>
